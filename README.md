# minpackex

## Description

This software is an extension to the popular double-precision version of [MINPACK-1](https://www.netlib.org/minpack) library, which provides routines to solve a system of nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares problems. Without any modification to the source code of [MINPACK-1](https://www.netlib.org/minpack) library, the goal of *minpackex* is to provide an easier-to-use API to the programmer, allowing user data to be shared across function calls.
