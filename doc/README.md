> Under construction. You will find all the possible configuration options supported by ```minpackex```, and detailed build-and-install instructions depending whether minpack is installed or not on your system. For systems without minpack, we will provide guides how to build it on different combinations of platform / Fortran compiler toolchain. Moreover, we will provide documentation to use ```minpackex``` as a CMake package after you installed it.
